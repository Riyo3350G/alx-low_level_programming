## Files
The following files are included in this repository:
|File|Description|
|-------|------------|
|0-object_like_macro.h| Header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.|
|1-pi.h| Header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.|
|2-main.c| C program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.|
|3-function_like_macro.h| Header file that defines a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.|
|4-sum.h| Header file that defines a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of two numbers x and y.|
## Usage
To use these files, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash

```
* Navigate to the 0x0D-preprocessor directory:
```bash
cd alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor
```
* Compile the C program 2-main.c using the following command:
```c
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 2-main.c -o cfile
```
* Run the compiled program using the following command:
```bash
