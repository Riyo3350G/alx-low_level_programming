# 0x0C-more_malloc_free
## Introduction
This repository contains the solutions to the 0x0C-more_malloc_free challenge from the ALX SE curriculum. The challenge covers advanced memory allocation and freeing techniques in C programming language.

## Requirements
To compile the programs in this repository, you need:

* GCC compiler
* GNU Make
## Usage
To compile any of the C programs in this repository, navigate to the challenge's directory and run the make command.

```bash
$ cd 0x0C-more_malloc_free/0-malloc_checked/
$ make
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.c 0-malloc_checked.c -o a.out
```
To run the program, execute the compiled file:

```bash
$ ./a.out
```
## List of Challenges

|0-malloc_checked	|Allocates memory using malloc and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.|
|1-string_nconcat	|Concatenates two strings.|
|2-calloc	|Allocates memory for an array using malloc and initializes it with zero.|
|3-array_range	|Creates an array of integers.|
|100-realloc	|Reallocates a memory block using malloc and free.|
## Credits
All challenges were designed by ALX SE. The C code solutions were written by REDWAN BEN YECHOU.
