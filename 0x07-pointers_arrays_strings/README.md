## Getting Started
To run these programs, you will need a C compiler, such as GCC or Clang, installed on your computer. You can then compile the programs using the following commands:

```shell
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -c file_name.c
$ gcc -o output_file file_name.o
```
Replace file_name with the name of the C file you wish to compile, and output_file with the desired name of the output file. The -Wall, -pedantic, -Werror, and -Wextra flags are used to enable additional compiler warnings and errors.

Once you have compiled the program, you can run it using the following command:

```shell
Copy code
$ ./output_file
```
