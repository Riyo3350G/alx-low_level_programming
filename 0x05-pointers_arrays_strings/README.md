# 0x05. Pointers, Arrays and Strings
## Description
This project contains several C programs that demonstrate the use of pointers, arrays, and strings. Each program solves a specific problem or implements a specific feature related to these topics.

## Files
The following files are included in this project:

### File	Description
| File          | Description |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|0-reset_to_98.c|A function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.|
|1-swap.c |A function that swaps the values of two integers.|
|2-strlen.c|A function that returns the length of a string.|
|3-puts.c|A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.|
|4-print_rev.c|A function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.|
|5-rev_string.c|A function that reverses a string.|
|6-puts2.c|A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.|
|7-puts_half.c|A function that prints the second half of a string.|
|8-print_array.c|A function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.|
|9-strcpy.c|A function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.|

## Usage
To use any of the programs in this project, you can compile the corresponding source file with a C compiler such as gcc. For example, to compile the 0-reset_to_98.c program, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 0-reset_to_98.c -o 0-reset_to_98
This will create an executable file named 0-reset_to_98 that you can run by typing ./0-reset_to_98 in the terminal.
```
