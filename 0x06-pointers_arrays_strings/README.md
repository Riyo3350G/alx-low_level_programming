# Pointers, Arrays and Strings
This project is part of the low-level programming and algorithm track. It covers pointers, arrays and strings in the C programming language.

## Concepts Learned
* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them in C
* Scoope of variables
## Files
The following files were used to test the code:
|Files|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|0-strcat.c|Write a function that concatenates two strings.|
|1-strncat.c|Write a function that concatenates two strings.|
|2-strncpy.c|Write a function that copies a string.|
|3-strcmp.c|Write a function that compares two strings.|
|4-rev_array.c|Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.|
|5-string_toupper.c|Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.|
|6-cap_string.c|Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.|
|7-leet.c|Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.|
|8-rot13.c|Write a function that encodes a string using rot13.|
|100-print_number.c|Write a function that prints an integer.|
|101-magic.c|A program that prints "A streetcar named Desire" without using any standard functions.|
|main.h|Header file containing function prototypes.|
## Requirements
* All the files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 and -std=gnu99.
* The code should follow the Betty style.
## Usage
To test the functions, compile the code using `gcc`:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o test
```
or
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu99 *.c -o test

```
Then, run the resulting executable:
```bash
./test
```
