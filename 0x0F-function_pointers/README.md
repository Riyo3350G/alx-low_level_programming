# 0x0F-function_pointers
This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of function pointers in low-level programming. These programs were written as part of the ALX Software Engineering program.

## Files
Here is a list of the files in this directory:
|File| Description|
|----|------------|
|0-print_name.c| This program demonstrates how to use a function pointer to print a person's name.|
|1-array_iterator.c| This program demonstrates how to use a function pointer to iterate through an array and perform an action on each element.|
|2-int_index.c| This program demonstrates how to use a function pointer to search for an integer in an array.|
|3-calc.h, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-main.c| These programs demonstrate how to use function pointers to create a simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations.|
|100-main_opcodes.c| C program that prints the opcodes of its own main function, followed by a new line.|
## Usage
To compile any of these programs, you can use the following command:

```php
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <program_name.c> -o <program_name>
```
Replace <program_name.c> with the name of the C file you want to compile, and replace <program_name> with the name you want to give the executable file.

For example, to compile the 0-print_name.c program, you can use the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-print_name.c -o print_name
```
Then, to run the program, simply type the name of the executable file:

```bash
./print_name
```
